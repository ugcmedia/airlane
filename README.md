# AirLane

This application will connect private jet owners with consumers looking to avoid the commerical airline hassle. The private jet owners will add their planes to the database, while the consumers will be able to search through our databases. When the consumer finds the flight they are looking for, they are able to book the flight.

In this application we are utilizing many different technologies. the following technologies used are:
	- Node.js
	- Express
	- Passport
	- MongoDB
	- Axios
	- React
	- React Bootstrap




# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

After confirming that you have an up to date git repository and a Heroku app created, complete the following:

1. Build the React app for production by running the following command:

```
yarn build
```
> Note: A yarn build will be required to register any new Post requests from any front-end JavaScript to to prevent any proxy server errors.

2. Add and commit all changes to git

3. Push to Heroku

If all previous steps were followed correctly, your application should be deployed to Heroku!
